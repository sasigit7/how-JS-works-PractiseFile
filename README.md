...

Do you want to learn the number #1 programming language that powers the internet?

Are you tired of wasting your time and money on random youtube videos or JavaScript courses that are either too simple, or too difficult to follow?

Or are you struggling to deeply understand and apply JavaScript to real projects?

If your answer is a big YES... Then this is exactly the course you are looking for!

...

So what is the course about?

This is a truly complete JavaScript course, that goes beyond what other JavaScript courses out there teach you.

I will take you from a complete JavaScript beginner to an advanced developer. You will not just learn the JavaScript language itself, you will also learn how to program. How to solve problems. How to structure and organize code using common JavaScript patterns.

Come with me on a journey with the goal of truly understanding the JavaScript language. And I explain everything on the way with great detail!

You will learn "why" something works in JavaScript, not just "how". Because in the modern JavaScript world of today, you need more than just knowing how something works. You need to debug code, you need to understand code, you need to be able to think about code.

To achieve our goal together, the course contains coding sessions, coding challenges, theory lectures, real-world projects and a final course exam.

This course is different because it's not just about writing code, it's also about how and why code works the way it does. Because it's the perfect mix between theory and practice. Because it focuses not only on small coding examples, but also on real-world projects and use cases.

So, by the end of the course, you will be a capable JavaScript developer, able to write, understand and debug JavaScript code using all the powerful features the language offers to us.

...

Here is exactly what we cover in this course:

• All the JavaScript and programming fundamentals: things like variables, data types, boolean logic, if/else statements, loops, functions, objects, arrays, and more.

• Everything you need to know in order to gain a deep understanding of how JavaScript works behind the scenes: execution contexts, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, and more.

• How to make JavaScript code interact with webpages: DOM manipulation. Learn how to select and change webpage elements, create new elements and handle DOM events.

• Complex JavaScript features such as function constructors, prototypal inheritance, first-class functions, closures, the bind and apply methods, and more.

• We are going to code 3 beautiful real-world apps to apply our knowledge and learn new concepts (I provide the starter HTML and CSS code for these projects).

• Learn how to organize and structure your code using modules and functions, how to create data privacy and encapsulation, and why that's so important.

• What's new in the most modern version of JavaScript: new features of ES6 / ES2015.

• Asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX calls and APIs.

• Modern JavaScript in 2018: Learn how to set up a modern development workflow with NPM, Webpack, Babel and ES6 modules.

...

Let's now find out if this course is for you. It's a perfect fit if...

Student #1: You want to gain a deep understanding of the most popular programming language in the world: JavaScript.

Student #2: You have taken other JavaScript courses but: 1) still don't really understand JavaScript, or 2) still don't feel confident to code real-world apps. This course is perfect for you!

Student #3: You are interested in using popular libraries/frameworks like React, Angular or Node.js.

Student #4: You want to get started with programming in general: JavaScript is a great language to learn how to code.

...
